Cyberbullying is a pervasive social behavior that can have a detrimental impact on victims' psychological, behavioral, and physical health. Teens who have been cyberbullied experience higher levels of internalized disorders like depression and anxiety, emotional distress, suicidal thoughts and attempts, psychosomatic complaints, worsening physical health, and externalized problems like increased delinquency and substance abuse compared to their peers who haven't been cyberbullied. These problems also last over time. According to research, cyberbullying affects both men and women, occurs everywhere in the world, and occurs at every stage of development. For interventions intended to lessen online antisocial behavior, it is crucial to comprehend the factors and processes that predict cyberbullying perpetration. In order to address the problem of detecting cyberbullying, well-known machine learning algorithms have been presented. When it regards online updates, the most current study emphasizes supervised learning. In this project, deep learning techniques like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Bi-Directional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) are developed in addition to more conventional machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression (LR), Vector Support Machine (SVM), and Multinomial Naive Bayes.
